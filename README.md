Matlab code to calculate the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate using the Negentropic Nucleation Theory as described in "On the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of immersion ice nucleation" https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/17119/2018/. 

Note: In the paper the value of Do is erroneously listed as 3.06e-9 m^2/s. The correct value is 3.06e-7 m^2/s.
